% Abstract English:
To achieve autonomy, \acp{amr} need to run different computation and memory intensive algorithms, such as perception, \ac{SLAM}, path planning, and learning. However, an \ac{amr}'s on-board computational and energy resources are limited by space restrictions and battery lifetime. Edge computing as an evolution of cloud computing brings application hosting from data centers down to the network edge to achieve low latency and bandwidth efficiency \parencite{Kekki2018}. With the emergence of edge computing, \acp{amr} have the opportunity to offload costly computation tasks to the edge, while only a small portion of the computation remains on the on-board system. However, depending on the application scenarios, offloading certain tasks from the \ac{amr} to the edge at all times may not be possible, beneficial or even feasible due to the network's latency, dynamic network changes, and resource availability. On the other hand, offloading computational workloads to the edge could impact the robot's safety, availability as well as its on-board resources. The exact influence on the robotic system will depend on the chosen offloading strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of certain offloading strategies on the robot's safety, availability, and task performance.
